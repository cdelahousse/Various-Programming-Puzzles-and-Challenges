/* 
 * Description:
 * You and a friend are working on a very important, bleeding-edge, research
 * paper: "Computational Complexity of Sorting Pictures of Cats with Funny Text
 * on the Web". The catch though is your friend wrote his part of the paper with
 * his hands shifted to the right, meaning the top row of keys he used weren't
 * "QWERTYUIOP" (regular US keyboard ), but instead "WERTYUIOP{".
 * Your goal is to take what your friend wrote, and convert it from his broken
 * shifted text back into regular english!
 * Formal Inputs & Outputs:
 * Input Description:
 * String ShiftedText - The shifted text in question. The only chracters you
 * have to deal with are letters, in both cases, and the following symbols: '{',
 * '[', ':', ';', '<', ','. The space character may be present, but you do not
 * have to shift that.
 * Output Description:
 * Print the correct text.
 * Sample Inputs & Outputs:
 * The string "Jr;;p ept;f" should shift back, through your function, into
 * "Hello World". Another example is: "Lmiyj od ,u jrtp", which corrects to
 * "Knuth is my hero" */
