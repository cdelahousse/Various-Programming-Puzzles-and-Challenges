[1] (Easy): Change Calculator
Write A function that takes an amount of money, rounds it to the nearest penny and then tells you the minimum number of coins needed to equal that amount of money. For Example: "4.17" would print out:
Quarters: 16
Dimes: 1
Nickels: 1
Pennies: 2

Note
This program may be different for international users, my examples used quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies. Feel free to use generic terms like "10 cent coins" or any other unit of currency you are more familiar with.
Bonus: Only print coins that are used at least once in the solution.
